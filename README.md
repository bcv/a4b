# Purpose
  I am trying to build a virtual android system (which works off qemu  - no fancy acceleration) but
  can be used to install banking apps. This will eliminate the need to carry an android device for banking (in case you are the one who is too much worried about security)

# Issues
* Sim support
* Certificates and detection
* safety-net detection

# Helping hands welcome - message me bhasker@unixindia.com
